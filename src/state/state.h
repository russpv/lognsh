/* Bash Manual
 *
 * For the shellâ€™s purposes,
 * a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded. 
 * A non-zero exit status indicates failure. This seemingly counter-intuitive scheme is used 
 * so there is one well-defined way to indicate success and a variety of ways to indicate 
 * various failure modes. When a command terminates on a fatal signal whose number is N,
 * Bash uses the value 128+N as the exit status.
 * 
 * If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127. 
 * If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.
 * 
 * If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection, the exit status is greater than zero.
 *
